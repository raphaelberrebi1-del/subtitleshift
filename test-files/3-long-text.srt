1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is a normal subtitle that fits within 50 characters.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
But this subtitle is intentionally way too long and exceeds the recommended 50 character limit per line!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Multi-line subtitles work too.
They should both stay under 50 chars.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This one has a very long first line that will definitely trigger the character count warning message.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Short text.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Another extremely long subtitle that goes on and on and on, way past the recommended character limit!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Best practice: keep lines under 50 characters
for better readability on all devices.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The editor will warn you about long lines!
